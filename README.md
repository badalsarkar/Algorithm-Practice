# Algorithm Practice

This repository contains solutions for different programming problems. My goal is to sharpen my
problem solving skill by solving algorithmic problems.

Each solution will have Big(O) analysis. As I am still learning, there might be some errors in the
analysis. If you find any error and care to tell me, please create an issue or email me at
badalsarkar86@gmail.com. Also, if you think any of the solutions can be optimized, let me know. Your
feedback will help me a lot.

## Who can benefit from this repo?

Anyone who has started learning algorithm. You can get a bunch of problems here which you can start
solving. You can also look at the solutions and the Big(O) analysis.

## Resources

I have used many resources for my learning.
